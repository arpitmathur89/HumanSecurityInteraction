"A fascinating story about a group of hackers who broke into the RBS WorldPay DBs through SQL Injection.  Russian authorities have nabbed the man accused of masterminding a coordinated global ATM heist of $9.5 million from Atlanta-based card processing company RBS WorldPay.  The hackers compromised RBS WorldPay???s database encryption to raise the amount of funds available on the compromised cards, and boost their daily withdrawal limits. In some case, the hackers raised the limits to $500,000.  According to the indictment, Tsurikov conducted reconnaissance of the RBS network after Covelin provided him with information about vulnerabilities in the system. Pleshchuk and Covelin then worked on exploiting the vulnerabilities to obtain access. Pleschuk allegedly developed the method for reverse engineering the encrypted PINs.  Once the hackers raised the account limits, they provided an army of cashers with 44 cards programmed with the account details. On November 8 that year, the cashers simultaneously hit more than 2,000 ATMs, netting about $9.5 million in less than 12 hours.The story did not specify the exact vulnerabilities exploited to manipulate the DB however the Indictment PDF (in the reference) lists actual SQL commands sent to the DBs (pages 10-11).If you then cross-reference this story with WHID entry 2009-51 where the Romania Hacker Unu released SQL Injection vulns in RBS WorldPay web applications, it seems most plausible that these Russian Hackers used similar vulnerabilities.",3/22/10,SQL Injection,Improper Input Handling,Monetary Loss,Finance,http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/alleged-rbs-hacker-arrested,No,,,Russia,,,,,http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2009/11/rbs-worldpay-indictment.pdf

The hackers ruined many of VAServ virtual servers. Some of them lost were for ever as the snippet from VAServ home page, serving as an emergency bulletin board, shows.</p><p>As tiny as VAServ is, probably no more than 3 people, in today's virtual and flat world they could serve tens of thousands of low cost web sites, many of them now lost for ever. Behind each one of these web sites there is a story of someone who worked hard, whether on a hobby or a small business and is now left with nothing. A comment made on one of the blog entries about the incident reads:</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>""yeah thanks for ruining my life for the last 2 years i had built up my site spending alot of money and giving up my job for nothing.........what am i going to tell the wife?""</em></p><p>Just think about tens of thousand of such stories.

Just days before the hack, someone <a href=""http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/8880"">posted on milw0rm</a> a long list of yet unpatched vulnerabilities in Kloxo, a virtual machine management software. The list certainly looks comprehensive enough to enable anyone to penetrate a site using Kloxo, which VAServ where, leading VAServ and others to believe that LxLabs, the Bangalorian software company behind Kloxo is the culprit. Somebody claiming to be the hacker <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/25617/update-new-information-on-the-vaserv-hack-that-wiped-100k-sites/"">commented to the inquistir blog</a>, claiming that weak password at VAServ where to blame for the hack, which <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/10/vaserv_follow_up/"">Rus Foster from VAServ denied</a>.</p><p>We may never know who is right and who is wrong.

In the past DNS hijacking required complete control over the DNS server. In recent years most applications are controlled through a web interface, including DNS servers. Earlier this year attackers found an XSS vulnerability in a common DNS platform to hijack unused DNS entries for phishingBut this was only a small prelude to the real thing. CNet reports that this time hackers took over an entire TLD (Top Level Domain, or country) DNS server using SQL injection, virtually defacing the Puerto Rican site of companies such as Google and Microsoft.The amazing story unfolds in the comments to CNet story, which outlines a mischievous professor and slow authorities who let him privatize and monetize on domain registration in Puerto Rico without any control.The question we are left with is whether other countries and geographies different?

Is it just that our view of the world is different than others, or have <span>Muslims</span> around the world become avid Time readers? The top rated person, ""moot"", which none of you heard about until now, proves that it is all about automation.</p><p>This specific poll distortion <a href=""http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/15/inside-the-precision-hack/"">reported by Paul <span><span>Lamere</span></span></a> is unique since a group of hackers called 4chan, led by ""moot"", took the time to fight Time's humble attempts to mitigate automation. Among the measures and countermeasures that 4chan and Time exchanged are:</p><ul><li>4chan distributed the simple get URL required to vote for moot through legitimate web sites and comment spamming. Such a link can easily be executed automatically by a web site user without his awareness using CSRF techniques.</li><li>Using a typical CSRF counter measure, Time added a salted and hashed key to ensure that the poll was submitted from its own poll form. However the key was authentication on the client by <span>Time's</span> poll Flash application <span>enabling</span> 4<span><span>chan</span></span> to easily find it out and overcome the issue. </li><li>The Time voting mechanism did not even check that the ranking in the vote was legal, so a link to vote down ""moot"" competitors in the list was also used until Time fixed the issue. Voting down is key to winning such a poll as 4chan competitors are not at rest running their own sophisticated campaigns.</li><li>Lastly 4chan developed sophisticated robots to auto-vote. Those robots overcome Time's anti-automation protections: since each user is allowed to vote just once in every 13 seconds, the robots uses open proxies to vote faster. Since time only prevents voting for the same person from the same IP, the robots used the extra 12 seconds available for each source IP to vote down competitors. The system also reports to a central server allowing monitoring of the voting rate!</li></ul><p><img src=""http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/images/4chan_voting_rate.png"" alt=""Rate of voting for &quot;rain&quot; as recorded by 4chan monitoring"" width=""480"" height=""149"" /></p><p>However this specific hack is ever more interesting.

Miley Cyrus already made her debut at WHID when her Twitter account was raided. But it seems that this was not her first cyber incident for her. As <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/10/miley-cyrus-hac.html"">reported by Wired</a>, late last year a hacker named  Josh Holly published private photos of Ms. Cyrus stolen from her G-mail account.</p><p>The hack was a relatively sophisticated one and a very good example of the risks of Web 2.0. Holly penetrated a MySpace administrator using social engineering. Using the account he gained access to a list of passwords which MySpace stored in an unencrypted form. Unbelievable. Since most of us use the same password for multiple services, Holly used Cyrus' MySpace password on her G-mail account gaining access and retrieving the photographs.</p><p>In a related but yet unconfirmed story Holly claims to have used the MySpace administrative account for an advertising scam by which he gained $50,000.</p>",10/20/08,Administration Error,Application Misconfiguration,Leakage of Information,Web 2.0,,No,,,,,,,,

"<p>An SQL injection robot is running wild and has already hacked hundreds of thousands of web sites. Since the robot plants malicious code in infected sites, its traces can be found by Googling for a name of Chinese sites referred to in malicious code.</p><p>As a security practitioner I often see SQL injection bots, and many times when I install ModSecurity, an open source application firewall but this bot is unique in the way it exploits web sites. It is easier to perform a wide scale attack by exploiting the least common denominator, which in the hacking world is the operating system. As a result most SQL bots tend to try to use SQL injection vectors that will enable issuing OS commands. A good example is a <a href=""http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21799/discuss"">Cacti vulnerability</a>: since it allows an OS command to be issued I often see bots looking for it in the wild. This attack is the first I have seen in which the actual attack vector is SQL based. The bot is modifying every record it has access to into a malicious code in the hope that it will be fetched and displayed by the application to its users.</p><p>A byproduct if this vector is that is that results are catastrophic for the site owners. While in a case of common defacement attacks restoring (or recreating) the homepage is all it required to get back to business, in this case the whole database is ruined.

Most notably, ""yet another"" XSS or CSRF vulnerability in a well known service is not considered news anymore. However the following story proves that no matter what, such vulnerabilities cannot be ignored.</p><p>The attack is simple, the result pretty frightening. An attacker, presumably Iranian, stole the domain name of David Airey, a graphic artist and a known blogger. The attack was very well timed with David's leaving to a long vacation. The goal was to extort money in order to return the domain. In David's case there is a happy end, as the attention he got helped him receive his blog back, with some loss in traffic, search engine ranking and time. But other victims of the attacker who steal domains for living may not be as fortunate.</p><p>Additional information:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1054"">When fixing is not enough</a> [Securiteam, Dec 28 2007]</li><li><a href=""http://www.davidairey.co.uk/google-gmail-security-hijack/"">WARNING: Google's Gmail security failure leaves my business sabotaged</a> [David Airey, Dec 24 2007]</li><li><a href=""http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-gmail-e-mail-hijack-technique/"">Google GMail E-mail Hijack Technique</a> [GNUcitizen, Sep 25 2007]</li><li><a href=""http://www.davidairey.com/david-airey-dot-com-restored/"">Collective effort restores David Airey.com</a> [David Airey, Dec 27 2007]</li></ul>",12/30/07,Domain Hijacking,Insufficient Process Validation,Fraud,Media,,No,,,Iran,,,,,

"<p><em><strong>Update (May 27th 2009)</strong></em> - The CardSystems incident is refusing to die. Merrick Back is now <a href=""http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/05/26/Merrick.pdf"">suing Savvis</a> for certifying CardSystems as CISP compliant while it systems where wide open. CISP is a VISA program for certifying credit card processing systems which existed prior to PCI DSS.</p><p>The actual damage to an organization of an attack is rarely disclosed, and coverage focuses on the Number_of_Records stolen. In the court documents Merrick reveals that its own damage from the CardSystems incident was $16,000,000! The money was paid to card holders to compensate for losses and for legal fees and fines.</p><p>The case is also interesting as it put to test the liability of the certifying entity (in this case Savvis) resulting from assessing. The results may have profound influence on the PCI QSA market and therefore PCI itself. David Navetta posts an <a href=""http://infoseccompliance.com/2009/06/03/merrick-bank-v-savvis-analysis-of-the-merrick-bank-complaint/"">excellent legal analysis</a> of the potential implications of the lawsuit.</p><hr /><p>This entry is a very important one. Most are already familiar with the infamous CardSystems incident where hackers stole 263,000 credit card numbers, exposed 40 million more and several million dollars fraudulent credit and debit card purchases had been made with these counterfeit cards. As a result of the breach CardSystems nearly went out of business and was eventually purchased by PayByTouch. CardSystems is considered by many the most severe publicized information security breach ever and it caused company share holders, financial institutes and card holders damage of millions of dollars.</p><p>But since the publication of the incident a year ago the way in which the breach occurred remained a mystery.</p><p>Recently new articles about the case (listed below) revealed that SQL injection was used by the attackers to install malicious script on the CardSystems web application database which where scheduled to run every four days, extract records, zip them and export them to an FTP site.</p><p>This is one of the most stunning examples where a web application security hole was used to launch a targeted attack in order to steal money.</p><p>Additional information:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1180411,00.html"">Cleaning up after a hack job: CardSystems' Christensen</a> [Information Security (mirror), Apr 14 2006]</li><li><a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0523148/0523148complaint.pdf"">FTC complain In the Matter of CardSystems Solutions</a> [FTC, ]</li><li><a href=""http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/CardSystems"">Midrange CardSystems Wiki</a> [Midrange, ]</li><li><a href=""http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2006-04/msg00051.html"">CardSystems was a Web Application Hack</a> [Cesar Cerrudo, <a href=""http://www.argeniss.com"">Argeniss</a>, Apr 18 2006]</li><li><a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/cardsystems_exp.html"">CardSystems Exposes 40 Million Identities</a> [Bruce Schneier, Jun 23 2005]</li></ul>",4/20/06,SQL Injection,Improper Input Handling,Credit Card Leakage,Finance,,No,,,,,,Credit Card Number,40000000,
