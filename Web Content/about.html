<h2>About Human Interaction</h2>
<img src="images/about.png" class="img-responsive fr" />
<p>HSI focuses on the amalgamation of three domains:Humans, Security, and the Interaction between them to benefit the typical user.</p>
<p><strong>Security Experts</strong> bring complex security concepts to the typical user in plain and non-technical terms.</p>
<p><strong>Human Experts</strong> bring complex human cognitive behavior, limitations, and perception to the domain of cyber world to help understand the human-both the user and the hacker.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction Experts</strong> look into the complex behavior between the security system and the human and how to design interaction with the user –and the hacker- in mind.</p>
