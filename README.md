# HumanSecurityInteraction

The goal of the project is to simplify cyber security concepts to the typical users to help them get better understanding of the problem and educate users with various kinds of security breaches and provide tools and techniques to protect from these incidents in the future.

"Incident Collection" folder contains the list of various incidents collected using the web parser.

"Web Content" folder contains Dynamic Website for Human Security Interaction. The website is running live at www.humansecurityinteraction.com.
The website is connected to MySQL database to collect the hacking incidents using an Incident Logging form. Please go to the Developments tab to view the project progress and developments made in 2017.
